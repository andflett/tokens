  "colors": {
    "title": "Colour",
    "description": "Colors use semantic tokens organized by layering (background, card, popover) and intent (primary, success, destructive, warning). Each color has foreground, subdued, and highlight variants for different emphasis levels. Always pair backgrounds with their matching foreground colors.",
    "prompt": "Use semantic color tokens with proper foreground pairing: bg-primary with text-primary-foreground, bg-success-subdued with text-success-subdued-foreground. Use subdued variants for subtle backgrounds, highlight variants for emphasis. Never use hex codes or arbitrary color values."
  },
  "spacing": {
    "title": "Spacing",
    "description": "Spacing uses a scale where each step is 4 pixels. When you tell your AI 'add some space,' it picks randomly. Be specific about your spacing values and stick to the scale.",
    "prompt": "Use spacing tokens from our scale (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64). Don't use arbitrary spacing values."
  },
  "typography": {
    "title": "Typography",
    "description": "Font sizes use a named scale from extra-small to extra-large. Line-height follows our leading scale (tight, snug, normal, relaxed, loose) and letter spacing follows our tracking scale (tighter through widest) defined in tokens. Weights range from normal to bold. Your AI understands these semantic names better than raw pixel values.",
    "prompt": "Use typography tokens: text-xs through text-xl for sizes, leading-tight/snug/normal/relaxed/loose for line-height, tracking-tighter/wider/widest for letter-spacing, and font-normal/medium/semibold/bold for weights."
  },
  "radii": {
    "title": "Border Radius",
    "description": "Border radius uses a named scale designed for concentric nesting. Each step works with our spacing tokens following the formula: outer_radius = inner_radius + padding. This creates visually balanced curves when nesting elements, avoiding the awkward mismatched corners that happen with arbitrary radius values.",
    "prompt": "Use border radius tokens: rounded-none, rounded-sm, rounded, rounded-md, rounded-lg, rounded-xl, rounded-2xl, rounded-3xl, rounded-full. For nested elements, step up one size (e.g., outer rounded-lg with inner rounded-md and p-4 padding) to maintain concentric curves. Don't use arbitrary radius values."
  },
  "shadows": {
    "title": "Shadows",
    "description": "Shadows use preset levels: small (subtle), medium, and large (pronounced). Don't tell your AI 'add a shadow'—specify which level. Cards usually get small shadows, modals get large.",
    "prompt": "Use shadow tokens: shadow-sm for subtle elevation, shadow for medium depth, shadow-md and shadow-lg for pronounced effects. Don't create custom shadow values."
  },
  "borders": {
    "title": "Borders",
    "description": "Borders use preset widths (1px, 2px, 4px) and styles (solid, dashed, dotted). Tell your AI which width and style from our token system, not arbitrary values.",
    "prompt": "Use border tokens: border (1px), border-2 (2px), border-4 (4px) with semantic colors like border-border, border-input. Use border-solid, border-dashed, border-dotted for styles."
  },
  "layout": {
    "title": "Layout",
    "description": "Layout tokens define breakpoints for different screen sizes and container widths. Tell your AI which container size to use and when layouts should change, instead of writing custom media queries or arbitrary widths.",
    "prompt": "Use layout tokens: container classes with max-w-sm/md/lg/xl/2xl, and responsive breakpoints sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:. Don't use arbitrary widths or custom media queries."
  },
  "animations": {
    "title": "Animations",
    "description": "Animation tokens define consistent motion for UI elements. Use duration tokens (fast, normal, slow) for timing, and easing tokens (ease-out, ease-in-out, spring) for natural movement. Apply these to transitions, hover states, and micro-interactions to create polished, professional interfaces.",
    "prompt": "Use animation tokens: duration-fast (150ms) for micro-interactions, duration-normal (200ms) for standard transitions, duration-slow (300ms) for larger movements. Use ease-out for exits, ease-in-out for state changes, and spring for playful bounces. Always use transition utilities like transition-colors, transition-transform with proper duration."
