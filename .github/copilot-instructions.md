use context7 when appropriate
always use tailwind classes and not custom css or styles
use existing style tokens (colours, spacing, typography, borders, shadows) from our tailwind theme, not not use custom values unless explicitly instructed
use existing components from our design system when possible
when creating components, prefer using shadcn/ui components and extend them as needed
if a component is used in more than one place, create a reusable component for it
favour heroicons or lucide icons over custom svg icons - DO NOT USE EMOJIS
do not use HOC components for layouts, use the nextjs app router layouts https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages
favour our animated tabs component over vanilla tabs
